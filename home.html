                <h3>Library Management System</h3>
                <p>In this project a Library Management System has been created with the help of Java.
                    The software used was Intellij IDEA.
                     Basically in the project the person was able to add, issue, return the books from the
                    library respectively.
                     To create the library java collection frameworks were used for creating arrays and
                    stack.
                     Methods have been implemented for each function for code reuseabilty and to avaid
                    repetation.
                     To issue as well as return the books stack has been used for addition and removal of
                    data.
                     Last and foremost at what date and time the user has issued or returned the book is
                    created with the help of Calendar and Date and Time class in java.
                    </p>

                <h3>Guess the number Game</h3>
                <p> In Guess the Number game the user predicts the number the computer has selected
                    and in how many guesses the user has guessed the number has been displayed at the
                    end of the game.
                     The project has been created with the help of Java.
                     The software used was Intellij IDEA.
                     In this project the each and every fragment has been divided into methods
                    respectively.
                     To perform the number to the computer java built in packages have been applied.
                     As the user predicts the number if the number is lesser, greater or equal the gussess
                    or the number of attempts increases by one.
                     The computer has a bound limit of only 100 numbers to to tell the user to predict the
                    number.</p>

                <h3>X and O Game for Android</h3>
                <p> X and O game is an Android Game created with the help of java and XML language.
                    The software used was Android Studio.
                     In this project the frontend part was developed in XML language.
                     We have to place grid and a total space for 9 images in such a way that it comes in a
                    3*3 matrix form.
                     It was done with Linear layouts vertical and horizontal respectively.
                     Coming to the logic part of the game if the X or O images conecutively matches in a
                    row it is a win.
                     The logic of the game was implemented in java. Here multidimensional arrays are
                    used to play the game and conditional statements for having iterative operations.
                     Lastly to run the game in the mobile an APK was generated and copied in the phone.
                     So, user can install the APK and play the game.</p>

                <h3>JetFoods-Food Delivery Website</h3>
                <p>This is my T.Y.Bsc.I.T. project
                    In this website I have used basic html css language for structuring the website also took
                    some help of bootstrap for various functions.
                    Also, for backend and database purpose I used PHP and PHPMyadmin respectively.
                    The entire website was created in an envioronment software called Visual Studio Code.
                    The database tables were created in PHPMyadmin having different security functions
                    like pasword hashing.
                    To upload, insert or delete the images I have used PHP coding also some SQL queries for
                    executing the desired output.</p>

For example we have to make a shopping list,study time table or a workout schedule we can create and store it on ListPad. The structure of the ListPad was created in HTML consisting of form actions various input styles etc. The designing part was done in CSS. The main logic of the ListPad was written in javascript. The localstorage setItem and getItem is used to read and write the content. This was all about the project ListPad.</p>
